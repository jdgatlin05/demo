<p>Wisdom High School was dedicated in 1965 before opening in 1966, when it served grades 7-11, adding twelfth grade in 1967. When the county school system was reorganized 
in 1971, Wisdom High School was designated a high school for grades 9-10. It remained this way until 1984, when it changed to its current 9-12 status. In 2004, the school was renovated and 
a new building was added, housing administrative and guidance offices, six science labs, an auditorium and several new classrooms. The media center was also expanded to include two computer labs, and the former auditorium was reconfigured to contain performing arts 
classrooms for band, chorus, dance, and orchestra. Today, Blank is home 
to around 1,500 students of diverse backgrounds who excel academically, artistically, and athletically.</p>
